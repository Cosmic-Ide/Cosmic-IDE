 * External renderer for spans.

 *

 * but initialize your required resources when the renderer is created.
 *
 * <p>Meanwhile, the renderer should be consistent with editor's current color scheme. Use colors
 * defined in your color schemes if possible.
 *
 * <p>Also try to create universal renderers for a certain effect.

 * <p>Note: the Paint object should not be modified or used to draw objects on the canvas It is only
 * provided for measuring. Use another Paint created by yourself instead.
